# deeplearning.ai-coursera-notes
Compiled notes for the [deeplearning.ai specialization on Coursera](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) taught by Andrew Ng.

I intend to continuously add to and improve these notes as I complete the 5-course specialization. See [here](https://johngiorgi.github.io/deeplearning.ai-coursera-notes/) for the notes compiled as a simple website.
